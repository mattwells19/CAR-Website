Feedback from club officers for current site:
  Like:
    The colors
    The Archive page
    Sponsorship levels on Sponsors page
    Information about the competition on the Competition tab
    Format of pages
    Navigation buttons at the top and bottom of the page including logo
    Links to competition website and rules
  Dislikes:
    Fonts are inconsistent
    Mobile version looks garbage
    No mention of club Outreach (add Outreach tab)
    Clicking on sponsors does not go to their website
    Multiple backgrounds
    Clicking on officers does not go to their LinkedIn Page
    Feels like you could scroll forever in Archive. Need a more efficient way of organizing content on the page.
    Home/Landing page feels empty/meaningless
