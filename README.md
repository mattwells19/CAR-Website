# Charlotte Area Robotics Website
A website for Charlotte Area Robotics built using ReactJS, TypeScript, Sass, NodeJs (with npm), and Material-UI.

This website started as a semester long project. Find the repo for that project [here](https://github.com/mattwells19/Quick-REACTions)

## About the website

This website was built from scratch from the ground up using create-react-app. No template or previous code used. The site is built in [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the transpiler, and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), along with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), were used during development to run the website locally and for the use of pre-existing packages. Finally, [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) was used for stylized components.

## Open Source

Yes all the code for the website is open source. You are encouraged to fork this repo and modify the code to make your own React website.

With that being said, if you do use this repo as a base, please include this repo and myself in your README for your project. Reach out to me if you would like as well! I'd love to see what you have created using what is here.

## How to Run

You will need:
  * NodeJS
  * An IDE (I highly recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

1. Clone this repo and open in your IDE.

2. Run `npm install` to install all of the node packages used during development.

3. Run `npm start` to start the web server. This should open a new window in your default browser. It will take some time to compile, be patient.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
